# Caesar-Cipher-Encryptor-and-Decryptor

This is a simple Python program that performs encryption and decryption of text using a basic Caesar Cipher algorithm. It allows the user to input a message, specify a key (shift value), and generate an encrypted or decrypted version of the message.

#Features

	•	Encrypt Message: Convert a plaintext message into an encrypted format.
	•	Decrypt Message: Revert an encrypted message back to its original plaintext form.
	•	Handles Both Cases: The program works with both uppercase and lowercase letters. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
